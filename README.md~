### Angualr Starter Kit

#### Motivation
If you are starting new project in AngularJs and you want to write moduler and maintainable application that can be use by
you or your team of any size and you dont want to spend more time on defining your folder structure. Then this starter kit
is for you.

This starter kit is created based on paste experiences from many different AngularJs application which now runs in production.
But we faced lot of problem for maintaning large codebase which was not structured properly. This is a attempt to create better
structure which will speed up development of large AngularJS application.
